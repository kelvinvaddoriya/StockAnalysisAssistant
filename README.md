The current README file appears to be focused on providing setup instructions for a React project built with TypeScript and Vite. It includes details about using ESLint configurations, React Plugins, and options to enhance type-aware linting.

Would you like me to rewrite or enhance the README to better align with the "Stock Analysis Assistant" focus, or do you have other specific edits in mind?
